### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1, part 1 was one of my favorite labs. Even though lab 1 was mostly setting up github and laying down the foundation for the rest of the semseter, it was very exciting setting everythings up and getting ready to learn c++. Overall an easy but essential lab experience that I enjoyed.

* Lab 3

Lab 3, part 1 was also one of my favorite labs. In lab 3 we learned how to use arithmetic operators and using the operator precedence rules to solve whether a certain equation is equal to 1 or 16. Another easy lab that I enjoyed just because it was very satisfying when the program compiled and worked.

* Lab 7

Lab 7, part 1 was a tough lab for me. This lab involved a lot of math and using vectors to calculate the average of different olympic judge scores. Although I struglled with this lab, I was able to learn the material and work with my parter in order to have our program run.
